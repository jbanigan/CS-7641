CS 7641 - Machine Learning: Supervised Learning

The purpose of this project is to contrast and compare 5 machine learning algorithms(Decision Tree, Neural Network, Boosting, Support Vector Machines, k-nearest Neighbors). The code will run through all the algorithms at once but need to be ran twice for two datasets.

Datasets:
1 - Wine Quality Dataset, can be downloaded at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
2 - Breast Cancer Wisconsin, can be downloaded at:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)

Code:
The code was written in Jupyter Notebook. 
Libraries required to run the code:
scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
To run:
1. open Supervised_Learning.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
2. Hit Kernel > Restart & Run All

Select a different Dataset:
in the second cell change "data_selection" field to 0 to run Wine Quality Dataset, and 1 to run Breast Cancer Dataset
