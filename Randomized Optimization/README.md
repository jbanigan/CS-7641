# CS7641 - Machine Learning: Randomized Optimization
There are two parts to this project. Part 1: is to use randomized optimization algorithms to optimize Neural Netowrk weights, Part 2: is to evaluate 4 random optimization algorithms (Random Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm) on 3 problems (Four Peaks, Queens, FlipFlop).
## Code:
All code was written in Jupyter Notebook
1. NN_Optimization.ipynb - this notebook contains the code to run the part 1 of the project. To run: open the notebook, press Kernel tab > press Restart & Run All button. The code will iterate through all Neural Netowrks and print all required plots for the project.
2. Optimization_Problems.ipynd - this notebook contains the code to run the part 2 of the project. To run: open the notebook, press Kernel tab > press Restart & Run All button. The code will iterate through all the problems and algorithms, and will print all required plots for the report. Second cell in the problem contains two integers that will change the problem length for the entire portion of this project.
## Dataset:
Wine Quality Dataset, can be downloaded at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
### Folders:
1. data folder contains the wine quality dataset required for the project
2. img folder contians all the plots produced by the code
