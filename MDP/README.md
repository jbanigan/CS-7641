# CS7641 - Machine Learning: Markov Decision Process
The purpose of this project is to solve two interesting MDPs, using Value Iteration, Policy Iterations and Q Learning.
MDPs that were analyzed are:
1. Taxi - is a problem with 500 states and 6 actions.
2. Frozen Lake - is a problem with 16 states and 4 actions.
## Code:
All code was written in Jupyter Notebook
To run: open the desired notebook, press Kernel tab > press Restart & Run All button. The code will run the appropriate algorithm and produce the plots.
1. FL_PI.ipynb - code to run Policy Iteration algorithm on Frozen Lake problem
2. FL_QLearning.ipynb - code to run Q-Learning algorithm on Frozen Lake problem
3. FL_VI.ipynb - code to run Value Iteration algorithm on Frozen Lake problem
4. Taxi_PI.ipynb - code to run Policy Iteration algorithm on Taxi problem
5. Taxi_QLearning.ipynb - code to run Q-Learning algorithm on Taxi problem
6. Taxi_VI.ipynb - code to run Value Iteration algorithm on Taxi problem
7. helper.py - this file contains helper functions such as printing plots
